# Emotion-Detector
Emotion Detector

## Project Overview
Emotion Detector is a machine learning–based application designed to identify human emotions from input data such as text, audio, or images (depending on the implementation). The system analyzes patterns using deep learning models and classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, and surprised. This project aims to demonstrate the integration of AI models into a practical application for real-time emotion recognition.

## Objectives
- Detect and classify human emotions accurately
- Provide real-time emotion prediction
- Build a scalable and modular deep learning pipeline
- Offer a user-friendly interface for interaction
- Support future expansion for multimodal emotion detection

## Features
- Emotion classification using deep learning (e.g., CNN/RNN/Transformers)
- Support for structured input preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation pipeline
- Visualization of results and predictions
- Modular and reusable code structure
- Easy integration with web or desktop applications

## Technologies Used
- Python
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (for deep learning models)
- NumPy & Pandas (data processing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)
- Flask (optional for web deployment)
- Scikit-learn (evaluation metrics)
